## ✨ About This Repository

Welcome to this comprehensive guide to fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms! This repository is your one-stop resource for learning and practicing core concepts in computer science. It's designed to be a practical toolkit for students and developers alike.

## 📁 Repository Contents

This repository is organized into several key sections to help you navigate easily.

### 📚 Lecture Slides & Theory
- **`slides/`**: 📖 A collection of lecture slides in Vietnamese, covering the theory and concepts behind various data structures.

### 💻 C++ Implementations
- **`src/`**: ⚙️ Well-commented C++ source files (`.cpp`) for all the major data structures. Each file provides a clear, runnable example.
  - **`List`**: Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly)
  - **`Stack`**: LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) implementations.
  - **`Queue`**: FIFO (First-In, First-Out) implementations.
  - **`Binary Tree`**: Tree traversal (DFS, BFS), insertion, and searching.
  - **`HashTable`**: Demonstrations of hash tables with collision handling (chaining).
  - **`Other`**: Miscellaneous data structures (e.g., Trie, Segment Tree).

### 📝 Exercises & Practice
- **`exercises/`**: 🚀 A dedicated folder with practice problems and solutions related to each data structure. Put your knowledge to the test!

### 💡 Algorithms
- **`algorithms/`**: 🧠 A collection of core algorithms, including:
  - **`Sort`**: Various sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort).
  - **`Find`**: Searching algorithms (e.g., Binary Search).
  - **`Dijkstra`**: The classic shortest path algorithm.
  - **`Greedy`**: Examples of greedy algorithms.
  - **`Other`**: Miscellaneous algorithms (e.g., Backtracking, Dynamic Programming).
